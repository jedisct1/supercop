/** General information
  *
  * The following type and functions are not actually implemented. Their
  * documentation is generic, with the prefix Prefix replaced by
  * - KeccakWidth200 for a duplex object based on Keccak-f[200]
  * - KeccakWidth400 for a duplex object based on Keccak-f[400]
  * - KeccakWidth800 for a duplex object based on Keccak-f[800]
  * - KeccakWidth1600 for a duplex object based on Keccak-f[1600]
  *
  * In all these functions, the rate and capacity must sum to the width of the
  * chosen permutation. For instance, to use the duplex object
  * Keccak[r=1346, c=254], one must use the KeccakWidth1600_Duplex* functions.
  *
  * The Prefix_DuplexInstance contains the duplex instance attributes for use
  * with the Prefix_Duplex* functions.
  * It gathers the state processed by the permutation as well as the rate,
  * the position of input/output bytes in the state in case of partial
  * input or output.

  *                     If @a ZByteLen*8 is greater than the rate r,
  *                     the last byte contains only r modulo 8 bits,
  *                     in the least significant bits.
  * @param  delimitedSigmaEnd   Byte containing from 0 to 7 trailing bits that must be

  *                     These <i>n</i>=|σ| mod 8 bits must be in the least significant bit positions.

  *                     from position <i>n</i>+1 to position 7.
  *                     Some examples:

  *                         - If |σ| mod 8 is 1 and the last bit is 1 then @a delimitedSigmaEnd must be 0x03.
  *                         - If |σ| mod 8 is 4 and the last 4 bits are 0,0,0,1 then @a delimitedSigmaEnd must be 0x18.
  *                         - If |σ| mod 8 is 6 and the last 6 bits are 1,1,1,0,0,1 then @a delimitedSigmaEnd must be 0x67.
  *                     .
  * @note   The input bits σ are the result of the concatenation of
  *                     the bytes given in Prefix_DuplexingFeedPartialInput()
