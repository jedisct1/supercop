/**
 * This function runs a single PRVHASH random number generation round. This
 * function can be used both as a hash generator and as a general-purpose
 * random number generator. In the latter case, it is advisable to initially
 * run this function at least 4 times before using its random output, to
 * neutralize any possible oddities of "Seed"'s and "lcg"'s initial values.
 *
 * To generate hashes, the "lcg" variable should be XORed with entropy input
 * prior to calling this function.
 *
 * @param[in,out] Seed0 The current "Seed" value. Can be initialized to any
 * value.
 * @param[in,out] lcg0 The current "lcg" value. Can be initialized to any
 * value.
 * @param[in,out] Hash0 Current hash word in a hash word array.
 * @return Current random value.
